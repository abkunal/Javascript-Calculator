### User Stories  
  
1. I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.  
  
2. I can clear the input field with a clear button.  
  
3. I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.  
  
Thanks for taking a look!
